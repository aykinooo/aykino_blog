      "summary": "A vulnerability was found in libvips up to 8.18.0. This affects the function vips_foreign_load_csv_build of the file libvips/foreign/csvload.c. The manipulation results in heap-based buffer overflow. The attack requires a local approach. The exploit has been made public and could be used. The patch is identified as b3ab458a25e0e261cbd1788474bbc763f7435780. It is advisable to implement a patch to correct this issue.",

      "summary": "The SPIP interface_traduction_objets plugin versions prior to\u00a04.3.3 contain an authenticated SQL injection vulnerability in interface_traduction_objets_pipelines.php. When handling translation requests, the plugin reads the id_parent parameter from user-supplied input and concatenates it directly into a SQL WHERE clause in a call to sql_getfetsel() without input validation or parameterization. An authenticated attacker with editor-level privileges can inject crafted SQL expressions into the id_parent parameter to manipulate the backend query. Successful exploitation can result in disclosure or modification of database contents and may lead to denial of service depending on the database configuration and privileges.",

      "summary": "The SPIP jeux plugin versions prior to\u00a04.1.1 contain a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the pre_propre pipeline. The plugin incorporates untrusted request parameters into HTML output without proper output encoding, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary script content into pages that render a jeux block. When a victim is induced to visit a crafted URL, the injected content is reflected into the response and executed in the victim's browser context.",

The plugin incorporates untrusted request data into a hidden form field that is rendered without SPIP output filtering. Because fields prefixed with an underscore bypass protection mechanisms and the hidden content is rendered with filtering disabled, an authenticated attacker with editor-level privileges can inject crafted content that is evaluated through SPIP's template processing chain, resulting in execution of code in the context of the web server.",

The plugin appends untrusted request parameters into HTML that is later rendered by a template using unfiltered environment rendering (#ENV**), which disables SPIP output filtering. As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can inject crafted content that is evaluated through SPIP's template processing chain, leading to execution of code in the context of the web server.",

The endpoints do not enforce authorization checks and do not use SPIP action protections such as securiser_action(), allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.",
