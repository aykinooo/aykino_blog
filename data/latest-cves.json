      "summary": "A flaw was found in the FTP GVfs backend. A remote attacker could exploit this input validation vulnerability by supplying specially crafted file paths containing carriage return and line feed (CRLF) sequences. These unsanitized sequences allow the attacker to terminate intended FTP commands and inject arbitrary FTP commands, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other severe impacts.",

      "summary": "A flaw was found in the FTP GVfs backend. A malicious FTP server can exploit this vulnerability by providing an arbitrary IP address and port in its passive mode (PASV) response. The client unconditionally trusts this information and attempts to connect to the specified endpoint, allowing the malicious server to probe for open ports accessible from the client's network.",

      "summary": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0, an IDOR vulnerability in the directory items endpoint allows any user, including anonymous users, to retrieve private user field values for all users in the directory. The `user_field_ids` parameter in `DirectoryItemsController#index` accepts arbitrary user field IDs without authorization checks, bypassing the visibility restrictions (`show_on_profile` / `show_on_user_card`) that are enforced elsewhere (e.g., `UserCardSerializer` via `Guardian#allowed_user_field_ids`). An attacker can request `GET /directory_items.json?period=all&user_field_ids=<id>` with any private field ID and receive that field's value for every user in the directory response. This enables bulk exfiltration of private user data such as phone numbers, addresses, or other sensitive custom fields that admins have explicitly configured as non-public. The issue is patched in versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0 by filtering `user_field_ids` against `UserField.public_fields` for non-staff users before building the custom field map. As a workaround, site administrators can remove sensitive data from private user fields, or disable the user directory via the `enable_user_directory` site setting.",

      "summary": "VideoLAN VLC for Android prior to version 3.7.0 contains a path traversal vulnerability in the Remote Access Server routing for the authenticated endpoint GET /download. The file query parameter is concatenated into a filesystem path under the configured download directory without canonicalization or directory containment checks, allowing an authenticated attacker with network reachability to the Remote Access Server to request files outside the intended directory. The impact is bounded by the Android application sandbox and storage restrictions, typically limiting exposure to app-internal and app-specific external storage.",

      "summary": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0, `discourse-policy` plugin allows any authenticated user to interact with policies on posts they do not have permission to view. The `PolicyController` loads posts by ID without verifying the current user's access, enabling policy group members to accept/unaccept policies on posts in private categories or PMs they cannot see and any authenticated user to enumerate which post IDs have policies attached via differentiated error responses (information disclosure). The issue is patched in versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0 by adding a `guardian.can_see?(@post)` check in the `set_post` before_action, ensuring post visibility is verified before any policy action is processed. As a workaround, disabling the discourse-policy plugin (`policy_enabled = false`) eliminates the vulnerability. There is no other workaround without upgrading.",

      "summary": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0, when the `patreon_webhook_secret` site setting is blank, an attacker can forge valid webhook signatures by computing an HMAC-MD5 with an empty string as the key. Since the request body is known to the sender, the attacker can produce a matching signature and send arbitrary webhook payloads. This allows unauthorized creation, modification, or deletion of Patreon pledge data and triggering patron-to-group synchronization. This vulnerability is patched in versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0. The fix rejects webhook requests when the webhook secret is not configured, preventing signature forgery with an empty key. As a workaround, configure the `patreon_webhook_secret` site setting with a strong, non-empty secret value. When the secret is non-empty, an attacker cannot forge valid signatures without knowing the secret.",
