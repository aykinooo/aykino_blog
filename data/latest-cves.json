      "summary": "Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network. Versions prior to `sha-7ff0e12` have a Self Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the \"PWA\" Canarytoken, whereby the Canarytoken's creator can attack themselves or someone they share the link with. The creator of a PWA Canarytoken can insert Javascript into the title field of their PWA token. When the creator later browses the installation page for their own Canarytoken, the Javascript executes. This is a self-XSS. An attacker could create a Canarytoken with this self-XSS, and send the install link to a victim. When they click on it, the Javascript would execute. However, no sensitive information (ex. session information) will be disclosed to the malicious actor. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image, or any Docker image after sha-7ff0e12.",

      "summary": "Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. In versions prior to 3.3.11, the API endpoint used to manage event series is missing an access check, allowing unauthenticated/unauthorized access to this endpoint. The impact of this is limited to getting the metadata (title, category chain, start/end date) for events in an existing series, deleting an existing event series, and modifying an existing event series. This vulnerability does NOT allow unauthorized access to events (beyond the basic metadata mentioned above), nor any kind of tampering with user-visible data in events. Version 3.3.11 fixes the issue. As a workaround, use the webserver to restrict access to the series management API endpoint.",

      "summary": "PMD is an extensible multilanguage static code analyzer. Prior to version 7.22.0, PMD's `vbhtml` and `yahtml` report formats insert rule violation messages into HTML output without escaping. When PMD analyzes untrusted source code containing crafted string literals, the generated HTML report contains executable JavaScript that runs when opened in a browser. Practical impact is limited because `vbhtml` and `yahtml` are legacy formats rarely used in practice. The default `html` format is properly escaped and not affected. Version 7.22.0 contains a fix for the issue.",
