      "summary": "A vulnerability was identified in itwanger paicoding 1.0.0/1.0.1/1.0.2/1.0.3. The impacted element is the function Save of the file paicoding-web/src/main/java/com/github/paicoding/forum/web/common/image/rest/ImageRestController.java of the component Image Save Endpoint. Such manipulation of the argument img leads to server-side request forgery. The attack may be launched remotely. The exploit is publicly available and might be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",

      "summary": "The Fluent Forms Pro Add On Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity in all versions up to, and including, 6.1.17. This is due to the PayPal IPN (Instant Payment Notification) verification being disabled by default (`disable_ipn_verification` defaults to `'yes'` in `PayPalSettings.php`). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send forged PayPal IPN notifications to the publicly accessible IPN endpoint, marking unpaid form submissions as \"paid\" and triggering post-payment automation (emails, access grants, digital product delivery).",

The vulnerability stems from missing bounds validation in the readblock() function, which performs unbounded memcpy() operations using attacker-controlled lengths from crafted Marshal data.",
