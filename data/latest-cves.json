This affects the function pictureDelete of the file PictureController.java. Such manipulation of the argument picName leads to path traversal. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. This product does not use versioning. This is why information about affected and unaffected releases are unavailable. This product is distributed under two entirely different names. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",

      "summary": "ZoneMinder is a free, open source closed-circuit television software application. In versions 1.36.37 and below and 1.37.61 through 1.38.0, there is a second-order SQL Injection vulnerability in the web/ajax/status.php file within the getNearEvents() function. Event field values (specifically Name and Cause) are stored safely via parameterized queries but are later retrieved and concatenated directly into SQL WHERE clauses without escaping. An authenticated user with Events edit and view permissions can exploit this to execute arbitrary SQL queries.",

      "summary": "Isso is a lightweight commenting server written in Python and JavaScript. In commits before 0afbfe0691ee237963e8fb0b2ee01c9e55ca2144, there is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the website and author comment fields. The website field was HTML-escaped using quote=False, which left single and double quotes unescaped. Since the frontend inserts the website value directly into a single-quoted href attribute via string concatenation, a single quote in the URL breaks out of the attribute context, allowing injection of arbitrary event handlers (e.g. onmouseover, onclick). The same escaping is missing entirely from the user-facing comment edit endpoint (PUT /id/) and the moderation edit endpoint (POST /id//edit/). This issue has been patched in commit 0afbfe0691ee237963e8fb0b2ee01c9e55ca2144. To workaround, nabling comment moderation (moderation = enabled = true in isso.cfg) prevents unauthenticated users from publishing comments, raising the bar for exploitation, but it does not fully mitigate the issue since a moderator activating a malicious comment would still expose visitors.",

      "summary": "BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. In versions 3.0.19 and below, when first joining a session with the microphone muted, the client sends audio to the server regardless of mute state. Media is discarded at the server side, so it isn't audible to any participants, but this may allow for malicious server operators to access audio data. The behavior is only incorrect between joining the meeting and the first time the user unmutes. This issue has been fixed in version 3.0.20.",

      "summary": "BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. In versions 3.0.21 and below, the official documentation for \"Server Customization\" on Support for ClamAV as presentation file scanner contains instructions that leave a BBB server vulnerable for Denial of Service. The flawed command exposes both ports (3310 and 7357) to the internet. A remote attacker can use this to send complex or large documents to clamd and waste server resources, or shutdown the clamd process. The clamd documentation explicitly warns about exposing this port. Enabling ufw (ubuntu firewall) during install does not help, because Docker routes container traffic through the nat table, which is not managed or restricted by ufw. Rules installed by ufw in the filter table have no effect on docker traffic. In addition, the provided example also mounts /var/bigbluebutton with write permissions into the container, which should not be required. Future vulnerabilities in clamd may allow attackers to manipulate files in that folder. Users are unaffected unless they have opted in to follow the extra instructions from BigBlueButton's documentation. This issue has been fixed in version 3.0.22.",
