Prior to versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0, `posts_nearby` was checking topic access but then returning all posts regardless of type, including whispers that should only be visible to whisperers. Use `Post.secured(guardian)` to properly filter post types based on user permissions. Versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0 patch the issue. No known workarounds are available.",
