      "summary": "In the query parser in OpenStack Vitrage before 12.0.1, 13.0.0, 14.0.0, and 15.0.0, a user allowed to access the Vitrage API may trigger code execution on the Vitrage service host as the user the Vitrage service runs under. This may result in unauthorized access to the host and further compromise of the Vitrage service. All deployments exposing the Vitrage API are affected. This occurs in _create_query_function in vitrage/graph/query.py.",

      "summary": "The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in versions up to, and including, 10.3.2. This is due to the /wp-json/wp-recipe-maker/v1/integrations/instacart REST API endpoint's permission_callback being set to __return_true and a lack of subsequent authorization or ownership checks on the user-supplied recipeId. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to overwrite arbitrary post metadata (wprm_instacart_combinations) for any post ID on the site via the recipeId parameter.",

      "id": "CVE-2026-1442",
      "summary": "Since the encryption algorithm used to protect firmware updates is itself encrypted using key material available to an attacker (or anyone paying attention), the firmware updates may be altered by an unauthorized user, and then trusted by a Unitree product, such as the Unitree Go2 and other models. This issue appears to affect all of Unitree\u2019s current offerings as of February 26, 2026, and so should be considered a vulnerability in both the firmware generation and extraction processes. At the time of this release, there is no publicly-documented mechanism to subvert the update process and insert poisoned firmware packages without the equipment owner\u2019s knowledge.",
