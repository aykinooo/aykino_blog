The application retrieves the 'dot' configuration parameter from the database and passes it directly to exec() without validation or sanitation. If an attacker can modify the fac_Config.dot value, arbitrary commands may be executed in the context of the web server process.",

The installer and upgrade handler expose LDAP configuration functionality without enforcing application role checks. Any authenticated user can access this functionality regardless of assigned privileges. In deployments where REMOTE_USER is set without authentication enforcement, the endpoint may be accessible without credentials. This allows unauthorized modification of application configuration.",

      "summary": "Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS). Prior to versions 5.73.11 and 6.4.0, an authenticated control panel user with access to Antlers-enabled inputs may be able to achieve remote code execution in the application context. That can lead to full compromise of the application, including access to sensitive configuration, modification or exfiltration of data, and potential impact on availability. Exploitation is only possible where Antlers runs on user-controlled content\u2014for example, content fields with Antlers explicitly enabled (requiring permission to configure fields and to edit entries), built-in config that supports Antlers such as Forms email notification settings (requiring configuration permission), or third-party addons that add Antlers-enabled fields to entries (for example, the SEO Pro addon). In each case the attacker must have the relevant control panel permissions. This has been fixed in 5.73.11 and 6.4.0. Users of addons that depend on Statamic should ensure that after updating they are running a patched Statamic version.",
