      "summary": "Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. FASP registration requires manual approval by an administrator. In versions 4.4.0 through 4.4.13 and 4.5.0 through 4.5.6, actions performed by a FASP to subscribe to account/content lifecycle events or to backfill content did not check properly whether the FASP was actually approved. This only affects Mastodon servers that have opted in to testing the experimental FASP feature by setting the environment variable `EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` to a value including `fasp`. An attacker can make subscriptions and request content backfill without approval by an administrator. Done once, this leads to minor information leak of URIs that are publicly available anyway. But done several times this is a serious vector for DOS, putting pressure on the sidekiq worker responsible for the `fasp` queue. The fix is included in the 4.4.14 and 4.5.7 releases. Admins that are actively testing the experimental \"fasp\" feature should update their systems. Servers not using the experimental feature flag `fasp` are not affected.",

      "summary": "NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. Prior to version 3.8.0, several NiceGUI APIs that execute methods on client-side elements (`Element.run_method()`, `AgGrid.run_grid_method()`, `EChart.run_chart_method()`, and others) use an `eval()` fallback in the JavaScript-side `runMethod()` function. When user-controlled input is passed as the method name, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser. Additionally, `Element.run_method()` and `Element.get_computed_prop()` used string interpolation instead of `json.dumps()` for the method/property name, allowing quote injection to break out of the intended string context. Version 3.8.0 contains a fix.",

      "summary": "Altec DocLink (now maintained by Beyond Limits Inc.) version 4.0.336.0 exposes insecure .NET Remoting endpoints over TCP and HTTP/SOAP via Altec.RDCHostService.exe using the ObjectURI \"doclinkServer.soap\". The service does not require authentication and is vulnerable to unsafe object unmarshalling, allowing remote attackers to read arbitrary files from the underlying system by specifying local file paths. Additionally, attackers can coerce SMB authentication via UNC paths and write arbitrary files to server locations. Because writable paths may be web-accessible under IIS, this can result in unauthenticated remote code execution or denial of service through file overwrite.",
