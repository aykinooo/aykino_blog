      "summary": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.2.0, user control of the argument of the `addJS` method allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PDF objects into the generated document. By crafting a payload that escapes the JavaScript string delimiter, an attacker can execute malicious actions or alter the document structure, impacting any user who opens the generated PDF. The vulnerability has been fixed in jspdf@4.2.0. As a workaround, escape parentheses in user-provided JavaScript code before passing them to the `addJS` method.",

      "summary": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.2.0, user control of the first argument of the `addImage` method results in denial of service. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized image data or URLs to the `addImage` method, a user can provide a harmful GIF file that results in out of memory errors and denial of service. Harmful GIF files have large width and/or height entries in their headers, which lead to excessive memory allocation. Other affected methods are: `html`. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF 4.2.0. As a workaround, sanitize image data or URLs before passing it to the addImage method or one of the other affected methods.",

      "summary": "changedetection.io is a free open source web page change detection tool.

This moves the base directory up to `/app/changedetectionio`, enabling unauthenticated local file read of application source files (e.g., `flask_app.py`). Version 0.53.2 fixes the issue.",
