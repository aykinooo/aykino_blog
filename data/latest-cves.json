      "summary": "A flaw was found in rubyipmi, a gem used in the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) component of Red Hat Satellite. An authenticated attacker with host creation or update permissions could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious username for the BMC interface. This could lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the system.",

      "summary": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. An administrator with `manage-users` permission can bypass the \"Only administrators can view\" setting for unmanaged attributes, allowing them to modify these attributes. This improper access control can lead to unauthorized changes to user profiles, even when the system is configured to restrict such modifications.",

      "summary": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Gateway route creation component. This vulnerability allows credential theft via the creation of misleading routes using a double-slash (//) prefix in the gateway_path. A malicious or socially engineered administrator can configure a honey-pot route to intercept and exfiltrate user credentials, potentially maintaining persistent access or creating a backdoor even after their permissions are revoked.",

This vulnerability allows an authenticated user to gain access to sensitive internal infrastructure headers (such as X-Trusted-Proxy and X-Envoy-*) and event stream URLs via crafted requests and job templates. By exfiltrating these headers, an attacker could spoof trusted requests, escalate privileges, or perform malicious event injection.",

This vulnerability allows exposure of sensitive client credentials and internal infrastructure headers via the test_headers field when an event stream is in test mode. The possible outcome includes leakage of internal infrastructure details, accidental disclosure of user or system credentials, privilege escalation if high-value tokens are exposed, and persistent sensitive data exposure to all users with read access on the event stream.",
