      "summary": "Bludit version 3.16.2 contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the post content functionality. The application performs client-side sanitation of content input but does not enforce equivalent sanitation on the server side. An authenticated user can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the content field of a post, which is stored and later rendered to other users without proper output encoding. When viewed, the injected script executes in the context of the victim\u2019s browser, allowing session hijacking, credential theft, content manipulation, or other actions within the user\u2019s privileges.",

The application does not implement anti-CSRF tokens or other request origin validation mechanisms for these administrative actions. An attacker can induce an authenticated administrator to visit a malicious page that silently submits crafted requests, resulting in unauthorized plugin uninstallation or theme installation. This may lead to loss of functionality, execution of untrusted code via malicious themes, and compromise of system integrity.",
