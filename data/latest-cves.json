      "summary": "A vulnerability was detected in Chia Blockchain 2.1.0. Impacted is an unknown function of the file /send_transaction. The manipulation results in cross-site request forgery. The attack may be performed from remote. The attack requires a high level of complexity. The exploitability is considered difficult. The exploit is now public and may be used. The vendor was informed early via email. A separate report via bugbounty was rejected with the reason \"This is by design. The user is responsible for host security\".",

      "summary": "A weakness has been identified in feiyuchuixue sz-boot-parent up to 1.3.2-beta. This vulnerability affects unknown code of the file /api/admin/common/files/download. Executing a manipulation of the argument url can lead to server-side request forgery. The attack can be executed remotely. Attacks of this nature are highly complex. It is stated that the exploitability is difficult. Upgrading to version 1.3.3-beta is able to resolve this issue. This patch is called aefaabfd7527188bfba3c8c9eee17c316d094802. Upgrading the affected component is advised. The project was informed beforehand and acted very professional: \"We have added a URL protocol whitelist validation to the file download interface, allowing only http and https protocols.\"",

      "summary": "The Angular SSR is a server-rise rendering tool for Angular applications. An Open Redirect vulnerability exists in the internal URL processing logic in versions on the 19.x branch prior to 19.2.21, the 20.x branch prior to 20.3.17, and the 21.x branch prior to 21.1.5 and 21.2.0-rc.1. The logic normalizes URL segments by stripping leading slashes; however, it only removes a single leading slash. When an Angular SSR application is deployed behind a proxy that passes the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header, an attacker can provide a value starting with three slashes. This vulnerability allows attackers to conduct large-scale phishing and SEO hijacking. In order to be vulnerable, the application must use Angular SSR, the application must have routes that perform internal redirects, the infrastructure (Reverse Proxy/CDN) must pass the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header to the SSR process without sanitization, and the cache must not vary on the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header. Versions 21.2.0-rc.1, 21.1.5, 20.3.17, and 19.2.21 contain a patch. Until the patch is applied, developers should sanitize the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header in their`server.ts` before the Angular engine processes the request.",
