      "summary": "A vulnerability was determined in yeqifu warehouse up to aaf29962ba407d22d991781de28796ee7b4670e4. This vulnerability affects the function addInport/updateInport/deleteInport of the file dataset\\repos\\warehouse\\src\\main\\java\\com\\yeqifu\\bus\\controller\\InportController.java of the component Inport Endpoint. Executing a manipulation can lead to improper access controls. The attack can be executed remotely. The exploit has been publicly disclosed and may be utilized. This product implements a rolling release for ongoing delivery, which means version information for affected or updated releases is unavailable. The project was informed of the problem early through an issue report but has not responded yet.",

      "summary": "ADB Explorer is a fluent UI for ADB on Windows. Versions 0.9.26020 and below have an unvalidated command-line argument that allows any user to trigger recursive deletion of arbitrary directories on the Windows filesystem. ADB Explorer accepts an optional path argument to set a custom data directory, but only check whether the path exists. The ClearDrag() method calls Directory.Delete(dir, true) on every subdirectory of that path at both application startup and exit. An attacker can craft a malicious shortcut (.lnk) or batch script that launches ADB Explorer with a critical directory (e.g. C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\Documents) as the argument, causing permanent recursive deletion of all its subdirectories. Any user who launches ADB Explorer via a crafted shortcut, batch file, or script loses the contents of the targeted directory permanently (deletion bypasses the Recycle Bin). This issue has been fixed in version 0.9.26021.",

      "summary": "openITCOCKPIT is an open source monitoring tool built for different monitoring engines like Nagios, Naemon and Prometheus. Versions 5.3.1 and below contain an unsafe deserialization sink in the Gearman worker implementation. The worker function registered as oitc_gearman calls PHP's unserialize() on job payloads without enforcing class restrictions or validating data origin. While the intended deployment assumes only trusted internal components enqueue Gearman jobs, this trust boundary is not enforced in application code. In environments where the Gearman service or worker is exposed to untrusted systems, an attacker may submit crafted serialized payloads to trigger PHP Object Injection in the worker process. This vulnerability is exploitable when Gearman listens on non-local interfaces, network access to TCP/4730 is unrestricted, or untrusted systems can enqueue jobs. Default, correctly hardened deployments may not be immediately exploitable, but the unsafe sink remains present in code regardless of deployment configuration. Enforcing this trust boundary in code would significantly reduce risk and prevent exploitation in misconfigured environments. This issue has been fixed in version 5.4.0.",
