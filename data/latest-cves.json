      "summary": "LinkAce is a self-hosted archive to collect website links. Versions 2.4.2 and below have a Stored Cross-site Scripting vulnerability through the Atom feed endpoint for lists (/lists/feed). An authenticated user can inject a CDATA-breaking payload into a list description that escapes the XML CDATA section, injects a native SVG element into the Atom XML document, and executes arbitrary JavaScript directly in the browser when the feed URL is visited. No RSS reader or additional rendering context is required \u2014 the browser's native XML parser processes the injected SVG and fires the onload event handler. This vulnerability exists because the lists feed template outputs list descriptions using Blade's raw syntax ({!! !!}) without sanitization inside a CDATA block. The critical detail is that because the output sits inside <![CDATA[...]]>, an attacker can inject the sequence ]]> to close the CDATA section prematurely, then inject arbitrary XML/SVG elements that the browser parses and executes natively as part of the Atom document. This issue has been fixed in version 2.4.3.",

      "id": "CVE-2026-27206",
      "summary": "Zumba Json Serializer is a library to serialize PHP variables in JSON format. In versions 3.2.2 and below, the library allows deserialization of PHP objects from JSON using a special @type field. The deserializer instantiates any class specified in the @type field without restriction. When processing untrusted JSON input, this behavior may allow an attacker to instantiate arbitrary classes available in the application. If a vulnerable application passes attacker-controlled JSON into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and contains classes with dangerous magic methods (such as __wakeup() or __destruct()), this may lead to PHP Object Injection and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on available gadget chains in the application or its dependencies. This behavior is similar in risk profile to PHP's native unserialize() when used without the allowed_classes restriction. Applications are impacted only if untrusted or attacker-controlled JSON is passed into JsonSerializer::unserialize() and the application or its dependencies contain classes that can be leveraged as a gadget chain. This issue has been fixed in version 3.2.3. If an immediate upgrade isn't feasible, mitigate the vulnerability by never deserializing untrusted JSON with JsonSerializer::unserialize(), validating and sanitizing all JSON input before deserialization, and disabling @type-based object instantiation wherever possible.",
