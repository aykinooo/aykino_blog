      "id": "CVE-2026-2410",
      "summary": "The Disable Admin Notices \u2013 Hide Dashboard Notifications plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.2. This is due to missing nonce validation in the `showPageContent()` function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add arbitrary URLs to the blocked redirects list via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",

      "summary": "The Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'ays_block' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 5.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

      "id": "CVE-2026-2301",
      "summary": "The Post Duplicator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary protected post meta insertion in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8. This is due to the `duplicate_post()` function in `includes/api.php` using `$wpdb->insert()` directly to the `wp_postmeta` table instead of WordPress's standard `add_post_meta()` function, which would call `is_protected_meta()` to prevent lower-privileged users from setting protected meta keys (those starting with `_`). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary protected post meta keys such as `_wp_page_template`, `_wp_attached_file`, and other sensitive meta keys on duplicated posts via the `customMetaData` JSON array parameter in the `/wp-json/post-duplicator/v1/duplicate-post` REST API endpoint.",

      "summary": "The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'ajax_search_recipes' and 'ajax_get_recipe' functions in all versions up to, and including, 10.2.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve sensitive recipe information including draft, pending, and private recipes that they shouldn't be able to access.",

      "summary": "The Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.1. This is due to the use of `strpos()` for substring-based hostname validation instead of strict host comparison in the `ajax_upload_image()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application, which can be used to query and modify information from internal services.",
