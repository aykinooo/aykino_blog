      "id": "CVE-2026-27510",
      "summary": "Unitree Go2 firmware versions 1.1.7 through 1.1.11, when used with the Unitree Go2 Android application (com.unitree.doggo2), are vulnerable to remote code execution due to missing integrity protection and validation of user-created programmes. The Android application stores programs in a local SQLite database (unitree_go2.db, table dog_programme) and transmits the programme_text content, including the pyCode field, to the robot. The robot's actuator_manager.py executes the supplied Python as root without integrity verification or content validation. An attacker with local access to the Android device can tamper with the stored programme record to inject arbitrary Python that executes when the user triggers the program via a controller keybinding, and the malicious binding persists across reboots. Additionally, a malicious program shared through the application's community marketplace can result in arbitrary code execution on any robot that imports and runs it.",

A network-adjacent, unauthenticated attacker can join DDS domain 0 and publish a crafted message (api_id=1002) containing arbitrary Python, which the robot writes to disk under /unitree/etc/programming/ and binds to a physical controller keybinding. When the keybinding is pressed, the code executes as root and the binding persists across reboots.",

      "summary": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0 have an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) in `ReviewableNotesController`. When `enable_category_group_moderation` is enabled, a user belonging to a  category moderation group can create or delete their own notes on **any** reviewable in the system, including reviewables in categories they do not moderate. The controller used an unscoped `Reviewable.find` and the `ensure_can_see` guard only checked whether the user could access the review queue in general, not whether they could access the specific reviewable. Only instances with `enable_category_group_moderation` enabled are affected. Staff users (admins/moderators) are not impacted as they already have access to all reviewables. The issue is patched in versions 2025.12.2, 2026.1.1, and 2026.2.0 by scoping the reviewable lookup through `Reviewable.viewable_by(current_user)`. As a workaround, disable the `enable_category_group_moderation` site setting. This removes the attack surface as only staff users will have access to the review queue.",
