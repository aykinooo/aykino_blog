      "summary": "CollabPlatform is a full-stack, real-time doc collaboration platform. In all versions of CollabPlatform, the Appwrite project used by the application is misconfigured to allow arbitrary origins in CORS responses while also permitting credentialed requests. An attacker-controlled domain can issue authenticated cross-origin requests and read sensitive user account information, including email address, account identifiers, and MFA status. The issue did not have a fix at the time of publication.",

      "summary": "OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services. In versions 9.5.13 and below, custom JavaScript monitor feature uses Node.js's node:vm module (explicitly documented as not a security mechanism) to execute user-supplied code, allowing trivial sandbox escape via a well-known one-liner that grants full access to the underlying process. Because the probe runs with host networking and holds all cluster credentials (ONEUPTIME_SECRET, DATABASE_PASSWORD, REDIS_PASSWORD, CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD) in its environment variables, and monitor creation is available to the lowest role (ProjectMember) with open registration enabled by default, any anonymous user can achieve full cluster compromise in about 30 seconds. This issue has been fixed in version 10.0.5.",

      "summary": "Lettermint Node.js SDK is the official Node.js SDK for Lettermint. In versions 1.5.0 and below, email properties (such as to, subject, html, text, and attachments) are not reset between sends when a single client instance is reused across multiple .send() calls. This can cause properties from a previous send to leak into a subsequent one, potentially delivering content or recipient addresses to unintended parties. Applications sending emails to different recipients in sequence \u2014 such as transactional flows like password resets or notifications \u2014 are affected. This issue has been fixed in version 1.5.1.",
