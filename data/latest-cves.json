      "summary": "Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a vulnerability in Fleet\u2019s configuration API could expose Google Calendar service account credentials to authenticated users with low-privilege roles. This may allow unauthorized access to Google Calendar resources associated with the service account. Fleet returns configuration data through an API endpoint that is accessible to authenticated users, including those with the lowest-privilege \u201cObserver\u201d role. In affected versions, Google Calendar service account credentials were not properly obfuscated before being returned. As a result, a low-privilege user could retrieve the service account\u2019s private key material. Depending on how the Google Calendar integration is configured, this could allow unauthorized access to calendar data or other Google Workspace resources associated with the service account. This issue does not allow escalation of privileges within Fleet or access to device management functionality. Version 4.80.1 patches the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators should remove the Google Calendar integration from Fleet and rotate the affected Google service account credentials.",

      "summary": "Fleet is open source device management software. In versions prior to 4.80.1, a broken authorization check in Fleet\u2019s certificate template deletion API could allow a team administrator to delete certificate templates belonging to other teams within the same Fleet instance. Fleet supports certificate templates that are scoped to individual teams. In affected versions, the batch deletion endpoint validated authorization using a user-supplied team identifier but did not verify that the certificate template IDs being deleted actually belonged to that team. As a result, a team administrator could delete certificate templates associated with other teams, potentially disrupting certificate-based workflows such as device enrollment, Wi-Fi authentication, VPN access, or other certificate-dependent configurations for the affected teams. This issue does not allow privilege escalation, access to sensitive data, or compromise of Fleet\u2019s control plane. Impact is limited to integrity and availability of certificate templates across teams. Version 4.80.1 patches the issue. If an immediate upgrade is not possible, administrators should restrict access to certificate template management to trusted users and avoid delegating team administrator permissions where not strictly required.",
