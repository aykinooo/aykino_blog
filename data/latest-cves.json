These are randomised by default.\n- The datasource can now be re-deleted by the attacker.\n- Once 30 seconds are up, the attack is spent and cannot be repeated.\n- No datasource with any other UID can be attacked.",

      "summary": "A security flaw was identified in the Orchestrator Plugin of Red Hat Developer Hub (Backstage). The issue occurs due to insufficient input validation in GraphQL query handling. An authenticated user can inject specially crafted input into API requests, which disrupts backend query processing. This results in the entire Backstage application crashing and restarting, leading to a platform-wide Denial of Service (DoS). As a result, legitimate users temporarily lose access to the platform.",

The issue occurs because a privileged D-Bus method responsible for exporting encryption metadata does not perform a policy check. As a result, sensitive cryptographic metadata can be read and written to attacker-controlled locations. This weakens the confidentiality guarantees of encrypted storage volumes.",
