      "summary": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was found in the /admin/edit_user.php page of Society Management System Portal V1.0, which allows remote attackers to inject and store arbitrary JavaScript code that is executed in users' browsers. This vulnerability can be exploited via the name parameter in a POST HTTP request, leading to execution of malicious scripts when the affected content is viewed by other users, including administrators.",

The configuration download response includes the router password and administrative password in plaintext. The endpoint also omits appropriate Cache-Control directives, which can allow the response to be stored in client-side caches and recovered by other local users or processes with access to cached browser data.",

Responses omit the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header and include attacker-influenced content that can be reflected into the response body. Under affected browser behaviors, MIME sniffing may cause the response to be interpreted as active HTML, enabling script execution in the context of the administrative interface.",
