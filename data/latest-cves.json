      "summary": "The The Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data and loss of data due to an improper capability check on the 'can_edit' and 'can_delete' function in all versions up to, and including, 6.15.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to update or trash events, organizers and venues via REST API.",

      "summary": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0, the function `Stream_EnsureCapacity` can create an endless blocking loop. This may affect all client and server implementations using `FreeRDP`. For practical exploitation this will only work on 32bit systems where the available physical memory is `>= SIZE_MAX`. Version 3.23.0 contains a patch. No known workarounds are available.",

      "summary": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Prior to version 3.23.0, the fix for the heap-use-after-free described in CVE-2026-24680 is incomplete. While the vulnerable execution flow referenced in the advisory exists in the SDL2 implementation, the fix appears to have been applied only to the SDL3 code path. In the SDL2 implementation, the pointer is not nulled after free. This creates a situation where the advisory suggests the vulnerability is fully resolved, while builds or environments still using SDL2 may retain the vulnerable logic. A complete fix is available in version 3.23.0.",

      "summary": "Vikunja is an open-source self-hosted task management platform. Prior to version 2.0.0, the restoreConfig function in vikunja/pkg/modules/dump/restore.go of the go-vikunja/vikunja repository fails to sanitize file paths within the provided ZIP archive. A maliciously crafted ZIP can bypass the intended extraction directory to overwrite arbitrary files on the host system. Additionally, we\u2019ve discovered that a malformed archive triggers a runtime panic, crashing the process immediately after the database has been wiped permanently. The application trusts the metadata in the ZIP archive. It uses the Name attribute of the zip.File struct directly in os.OpenFile calls without validation, allowing files to be written outside the intended directory. The restoration logic assumes a specific directory structure within the ZIP. When provided with a \"minimalist\" malicious ZIP, the application fails to validate the length of slices derived from the archive contents. Specifically, at line 154, the code attempts to access an index of len(ms)-2 on an insufficiently populated slice, triggering a panic. Version 2.0.0 fixes the issue.",

      "summary": "Vikunja is an open-source self-hosted task management platform. Prior to version 2.0.0, the application allows users to upload SVG files as task attachments. SVG is an XML-based format that supports JavaScript execution through elements such as <script> tags or event handlers like onload. The application does not sanitize SVG content before storing it. When the uploaded SVG file is accessed via its direct URL, it is rendered inline in the browser under the application's origin. As a result, embedded JavaScript executes in the context of the authenticated user. Because the authentication token is stored in localStorage, it is accessible via JavaScript and can be retrieved by a malicious payload. Version 2.0.0 patches this issue.",
