      "summary": "jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to 4.2.0, user control of properties and methods of the Acroform module allows users to inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized input to one of the following property, a user can inject arbitrary PDF objects, such as JavaScript actions, which are executed when the victim hovers over the radio option. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.2.0. As a workaround, sanitize user input before passing it to the vulnerable API members.",

      "summary": "Echo is a Go web framework. In versions 5.0.0 through 5.0.2 on Windows, Echo\u2019s `middleware.Static` using the default filesystem allows path traversal via backslashes, enabling unauthenticated remote file read outside the static root. In `middleware/static.go`, the requested path is unescaped and normalized with `path.Clean` (URL semantics). `path.Clean` does not treat `\\` as a path separator, so `..\\` sequences remain in the cleaned path. The resulting path is then passed to `currentFS.Open(...)`. When the filesystem is left at the default (nil), Echo uses `defaultFS` which calls `os.Open` (`echo.go:792`). On Windows, `os.Open` treats `\\` as a path separator and resolves `..\\`, allowing traversal outside the static root. Version 5.0.3 fixes the issue.",

      "summary": "Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. Versions prior to 3.3.10 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when uploading certain file types as materials. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.10 to receive a patch. To apply the fix itself updating is sufficient, but to benefit from the strict Content Security Policy (CSP) Indico now applies by default for file downloads, update the webserver config in case one uses nginx with Indico's `STATIC_FILE_METHOD` set to `xaccelredirect`. For further directions, consult the GitHub Security advisory or Indico setup documentation. Some workarounds are available. Use the webserver config to apply a strict CSP for material download endpoints, and/or only let trustworthy users create content (including material uploads, which speakers can typically do as well) on Indico.",
