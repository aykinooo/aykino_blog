The Remote Access Server uses a 4-digit OTP and does not enforce effective throttling or lockout within the OTP validity window, allowing an attacker with network reachability to the server to repeatedly attempt OTP verification until a valid user_session cookie is issued. Successful exploitation results in unauthorized access to the Remote Access interface, limited to media files explicitly shared by the VLC for Android user.",
