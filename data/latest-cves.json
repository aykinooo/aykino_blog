      "summary": "The EM Cost Calculator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 2.3.1. This is due to the plugin storing attacker-controlled 'customer_name' data and rendering it in the admin customer list without output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute when an administrator views the EMCC Customers page.",

      "summary": "The Custom Logo plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 2.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",

      "summary": "The TP2WP Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Watched domains' textarea on the attachment importer settings page in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping when domains are saved via AJAX and rendered with echo implode() without esc_textarea().

Specifically, the plugin uses `htmlspecialchars_decode()` after `wp_kses_post()`, which decodes HTML entities back into executable code after sanitization has occurred. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",

      "summary": "Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server.  A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.12.0-beta of the Audiobookshelf mobile application that allows arbitrary JavaScript execution through malicious library metadata. Attackers with library modification privileges can execute code in victim users' browsers/WebViews, potentially leading to session hijacking, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to native device APIs. The issue is fixed in audiobookshelf-app version 0.12.0-beta, corresponding to audiobookshelf version 2.12.0.",
