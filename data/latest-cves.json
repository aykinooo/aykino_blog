      "id": "CVE-2026-26104",
      "summary": "A flaw was found in the udisks storage management daemon that allows unprivileged users to back up LUKS encryption headers without authorization. The issue occurs because a privileged D-Bus method responsible for exporting encryption metadata does not perform a policy check. As a result, sensitive cryptographic metadata can be read and written to attacker-controlled locations. This weakens the confidentiality guarantees of encrypted storage volumes.",

      "id": "CVE-2026-26103",
      "summary": "A flaw was found in the udisks storage management daemon that exposes a privileged D-Bus API for restoring LUKS encryption headers without proper authorization checks. The issue allows a local unprivileged user to instruct the root-owned udisks daemon to overwrite encryption metadata on block devices. This can permanently invalidate encryption keys and render encrypted volumes inaccessible. Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition through irreversible data loss.",
