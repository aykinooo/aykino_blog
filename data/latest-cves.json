      "id": "CVE-2026-2636",
      "summary": "This vulnerability is caused by a CWE\u2011159: \"Improper Handling of Invalid Use of Special Elements\" weakness, which leads to an unrecoverable inconsistency in the CLFS.sys driver. This condition forces a call to the KeBugCheckEx function, allowing an unprivileged user to trigger a system crash. Microsoft silently fixed this vulnerability in the September 2025 cumulative update for Windows 11 2024 LTSC and Windows Server 2025. Windows 25H2 (released in September) was released with the patch. Windows 1123h2 and earlier versions remain vulnerable.",

      "summary": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol. Versions on the 2.x branch prior to to 2.11.8 and on the 3.x branch prior to 3.23.0 have an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the FreeRDP client's RDPGFX channel that allows a malicious RDP server to read uninitialized heap memory by sending a crafted WIRE_TO_SURFACE_2 PDU with a `bitmapDataLength` value larger than the actual data in the packet. This can lead to information disclosure or client crashes when a user connects to a malicious server. Versions 2.11.8 and 3.23.0 fix the issue.",
