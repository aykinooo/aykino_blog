      "summary": "HTTP::Session2 versions before 1.12 for Perl for Perl may generate weak session ids using the rand() function.\n\nThe HTTP::Session2 session id generator returns a SHA-1 hash seeded with the built-in rand function, the epoch time, and the PID. The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand() function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.\n\nHTTP::Session2 after version 1.02 will attempt to use the /dev/urandom device to generate a session id, but if the device is unavailable (for example, under Windows), then it will revert to the insecure method described above.",

      "summary": "ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Prior to version 5.5.3 #59, collection item operations are vulnerable to authorization flaws, allowing a normal authenticated user to modify another user\u2019s collection items. This affects both add item (/actions/add_to_collection.php) due to missing authorization checks and delete item (/manage_collections.php?mode=manage_items...) due to a broken ownership check in removeItemFromCollection(). As a result, attackers can insert and remove items from collections they do not own. Version 5.5.3 #59 fixes the issue.",

      "summary": "pillow_heif is a Python library for working with HEIF images and plugin for Pillow. Prior to version 1.3.0, an integer overflow in the encode path buffer validation of `_pillow_heif.c` allows an attacker to bypass bounds checks by providing large image dimensions, resulting in a heap out-of-bounds read. This can lead to information disclosure (server heap memory leaking into encoded images) or denial of service (process crash). No special configuration is required \u2014 this triggers under default settings. Version 1.3.0 fixes the issue.",

Versions prior to 26.0.9, 25.0.87, and 6.8.154 have an authenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the TNEF attachment processing flow. The vulnerable path extracts attacker-controlled files from `winmail.dat` and then invokes `zip` with a shell wildcard (`*`). Because extracted filenames are attacker-controlled, they can be interpreted as `zip` options and lead to arbitrary command execution. Versions 26.0.9, 25.0.87, and 6.8.154 fix the issue.",
