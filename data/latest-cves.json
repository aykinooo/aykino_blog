      "summary": "A flaw has been found in SourceCodester/Patrick Mvuma Patients Waiting Area Queue Management System 1.0. Affected by this vulnerability is an unknown functionality of the file /queue.php. This manipulation of the argument firstname/lastname causes cross site scripting. The attack is possible to be carried out remotely. The exploit has been published and may be used.",

      "summary": "The Responsive Lightbox & Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.1. This is due to the use of `strpos()` for substring-based hostname validation instead of strict host comparison in the `ajax_upload_image()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application, which can be used to query and modify information from internal services.",

      "summary": "The Geo Mashup plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the 'sort' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.13.17. This is due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.",

      "id": "CVE-2026-1929",
      "summary": "The Advanced Woo Labels plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.37. This is due to the use of `call_user_func_array()` with user-controlled callback and parameters in the `get_select_option_values()` AJAX handler without an allowlist of permitted callbacks or a capability check. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to execute arbitrary PHP functions and operating system commands on the server via the 'callback' parameter.",

    {
      "id": "CVE-2026-1916",
      "summary": "The WPGSI: Spreadsheet Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification and loss of data due to missing capability checks and an insecure authentication mechanism on the `wpgsi_callBackFuncAccept` and `wpgsi_callBackFuncUpdate` REST API functions in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. Both REST endpoints use `permission_callback => '__return_true'`, allowing unauthenticated access. The plugin's custom token-based validation relies on a Base64-encoded JSON object containing the user ID and email address, but is not cryptographically signed. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to forge tokens using publicly enumerable information (admin user ID and email) to create, modify, and delete arbitrary WordPress posts and pages, granted they know the administrator's email address and an active integration ID with remote updates enabled.",
